/**
 * A single-value metrics aggregation that computes the weighted average of numeric values that are extracted from the aggregated documents.
 * These values can be extracted either from specific numeric fields in the documents.
 *
 * [Elasticsearch reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics-weight-avg-aggregation.html)
 *
 * Added in Elasticsearch v6.4.0
 * [Release notes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/release-notes-6.4.0.html)
 *
 * As a formula, a weighted average is ∑(value * weight) / ∑(weight)
 *
 * @example
 * // Compute the average grade over all documents, weighing by teacher score.
 * const agg = esb.weightedAverageAggregation('avg_grade', 'grade', 'teacher_score');
 *
 * @example
 * // Compute the average grade where the weight is calculated by a script.
 * // Filling in missing values as '10'.
 * const agg = esb.weightedAverageAggregation('avg_grade', 'grade')
 *      .weight(esb.script('inline', "doc['teacher_score'].value").lang('painless'), 10)
 * );
 *
 * @example
 * // Compute the average grade, weighted by teacher score, filling in missing values.
 * const agg = esb.weightedAverageAggregation('avg_grade').value('grade', 5).weight('teacher_score', 10));
 *
 * @example
 * // Compute the average grade over all documents, weighing by teacher score.
 * const agg = esb.weightedAverageAggregation('avg_grade').value('grade').weight('teacher_score');
 *
 *
 * @param {string} name The name which will be used to refer to this aggregation.
 * @param {string=} value The field or script to use as the value
 * @param {string=} weight The field or script to use as the weight

 * @extends MetricsAggregationBase
