/**
 * A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating
 * on parent docs from nested documents. Effectively this
 * aggregation can break out of the nested block structure and
 * link to other nested structures or the root document,
 * which allows nesting other aggregations that arenâ€™t part of
 * the nested object in a nested aggregation.
 *
 * The `reverse_nested` aggregation must be defined inside a nested aggregation.
 *
 * [Elasticsearch reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-reverse-nested-aggregation.html)
 *
 * @example
 * const reqBody = esb.requestBodySearch()
 *     .query(esb.matchQuery('name', 'led tv'))
 *     .agg(
 *         esb.nestedAggregation('comments', 'comments').agg(
 *             esb.termsAggregation('top_usernames', 'comments.username').agg(
 *                 esb.reverseNestedAggregation('comment_to_issue').agg(
 *                     esb.termsAggregation('top_tags_per_comment', 'tags')
 *                 )
 *             )
 *         )
 *     );
 *
 * @param {string} name The name which will be used to refer to this aggregation.
 * @param {string=} path Defines to what nested object field should be joined back.
 * The default is empty, which means that it joins back to the root / main document
 * level.
