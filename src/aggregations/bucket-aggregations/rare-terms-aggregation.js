/**
 * A multi-bucket value source based aggregation which finds
 * "rare" terms â€” terms that are at the long-tail of the
 * distribution and are not frequent. Conceptually, this is like
 * a terms aggregation that is sorted by `_count` ascending.
 * As noted in the terms aggregation docs, actually ordering
 * a `terms` agg by count ascending has unbounded error.
 * Instead, you should use the `rare_terms` aggregation
